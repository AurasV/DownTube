## Why?
Couldn't find an easy to use app/website so I made one myself

Will update when/if needed/I have time
## Libraries used:
``PySimpleGUI`` and ``yt-dlp``

## Warnings:
***The exe isn't signed so Windows will complain about it, if you don't trust it, use the given python code***

~~***As of right now the downloaded files go to the same folder the exe/script is in this will, as well, be reworked in future versions***~~

~~***The downloaded file will have the ``modified date`` as the date it was uploaded to youtube!!!***~~ 

~~***Meaning if you have the files in the folder ordered by date it might not show up at the beginning of the folder!!!***~~ - Partially Fixed (Only for single file downloads)

***If the program freezes check the console, it's probably downloading a large file that takes a while***

***Do NOT close the program unless you want to give up on the download***

~~***If you plug in a video from a playlist it will download the whole playlist FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE PLAYLIST***~~

~~***I'm working on a fix as soon as I have the time***~~ - Fixed





## Usage:
Double click the exe and the console will appear first

Wait for it to finish loading then the GUI will appear

Plug in the YouTube link and choose what do you want (Video + Audio or Audio only, Resolution)

The next highest resolution will be chosen if the desired one isn't available
