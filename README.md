## Why?
Couldn't find an easy to use app/website so I made one myself

Will update when/if needed/I have time
## Libraries used:
``PySimpleGUI`` and ``yt-dlp``

## Warnings:
***The exe isn't signed so Windows will complain about it, if you don't trust it, use the given python code***

~~***As of right now the downloaded files go to the same folder the exe/script is in this will, as well, be reworked in future versions***~~

~~***The downloaded file will have the ``modified date`` as the date it was uploaded to youtube!!!***~~ 

~~***Meaning if you have the files in the folder ordered by date it might not show up at the beginning of the folder!!!***~~ - Partially Fixed (Only for single file downloads)

***If the program freezes check the console, it's probably downloading a large file that takes a while or a playlist***

***Do NOT close the program unless you want to give up on the download***

~~***If you plug in a video from a playlist it will download the whole playlist FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE PLAYLIST***~~

~~***I'm working on a fix as soon as I have the time***~~ - Fixed





## Usage:
Double click the exe and the console will appear first
![console first](https://github.com/AurasV/DownTube/assets/80701407/b93526ad-8990-430d-a1e5-c976c42cecf6)
Wait for it to finish loading then the GUI will appear

![gui](https://github.com/AurasV/DownTube/assets/80701407/97579dda-fc9e-4b80-8f20-4172cd4bf312)

Plug in the YouTube link and choose what do you want (Video + Audio or Audio only, Resolution, Whole Playlist)

The next highest resolution will be chosen if the desired one isn't available

After clicking on the ``Download`` button you'll get the progress in the console
