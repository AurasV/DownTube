# YT-Downloader

## Libraries used:
``PySimpleGUI`` and ``yt-dlp``

## Warnings:
***If the program freezes check the console, it's probably downloading a large file that takes a while***

***Do NOT close the program unless you want to give up on the download***

***If you plug in a video from a playlist it will download the whole playlist FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE PLAYLIST***

***I'm working on a fix as soon as I have the time***
## Usage:
